## Project 6 - Website Performance Optimization

The goal of this project was to create a single page application that would display interactive points of interest on a neighborhood map utilizing the Google Maps API. 
In particular, I created a map showcasing various popular dog runs located in New York City and incorporated Foursquare API to showcase images taken by local park goers.
A filter function was also implemented which utilizes KnockoutJS MVVM framework to dynamically update the UI as the user searches for a particular park.
